  <p class="pagesubline">
    Configure the virtual participants in your social media simulation. Each
    agent represents a different type of social media user with unique
    perspectives and communication styles. You can modify their personalities
    and instructions to see how different combinations of voices affect the
    overall conversation.

  <h3 class="sectionheading">Customize Instructions</h3>
  <p class="sectionsubline">
    These are the basic rules that guide how all agents create posts and
    replies. Think of them as the general conversation guidelines - like telling
    everyone at a party what topics to discuss. Changes here affect every
    agent's behavior equally

  <h3 class="sectionheading">Customize Personas</h3>
  <p class="sectionsubline">
    Each persona is a unique virtual participant with their own personality,
    interests, and communication style. You can edit existing personas to change
    how they express themselves, add new ones to diversify the conversation, or
    remove personas to simplify the simulation. The icon and name help you
    identify who's speaking in the feed.
