  <h2 class="pageheading">Ranker Settings</h2>
  <p class="pagesubline">
    Control how posts are ordered in your feed. Just like real social media
    platforms use algorithms to decide what you see first, this page lets you
    experiment with different ranking methods to understand their impact on the
    conversation's visibility and tone.

  <h3 class="sectionheading">Ranker Type</h3>
  <p class="sectionsubline">
    Choose between showing posts in the order they were created (chronological)
    or prioritizing posts based on their emotional intensity (sentiment-based).
    Sentiment-based ranking pushes posts with stronger emotions - whether
    positive or negative - to the top of your feed, similar to how
    engagement-driven algorithms work on real platforms.

  <h3 class="sectionheading">Sentiment Weighting</h3>
  <p class="sectionsubline">
    Fine-tune how much positive and negative emotions influence post visibility
    when using sentiment-based ranking. Moving the sliders changes whether
    cheerful, supportive posts or critical, angry posts get more prominence in
    the feed. Set both high to amplify all emotional content, or adjust them
    differently to see how favoring one type of emotion changes the
    conversation's overall tone. This mirrors how real platforms might optimize
    for different types of engagement.
