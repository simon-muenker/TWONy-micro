    Welcome to <strong>TWONy-micro, an interactive demonstration</strong> that shows
    how social media algorithms affect online conversations. Watch as virtual agents
    interact with each other, creating posts and replies while different ranking
    systems influence what content appears at the top of your feed. This simulation
    helps visualize how algorithmic choices shape the tone and direction of online
    discourse.

    This simulation uses AI to generate realistic social media posts and
    replies. To keep this educational tool free and accessible for everyone, <strong
      >we ask you to provide your own Hugging Face API key</strong
    > - it's like bringing your own ticket to use the AI service. This is completely
    <strong
      >free for light use, and your key is stored only in your browser.</strong
    > As a non-profit research project, this approach lets us demonstrate how social
    media algorithms work without charging users or bearing hosting costs.
